<h1>Faction Forum Lounges</h1>
<p>
Faction Forum Lounges will be the Social Scene, the heart and soul of monoGames - we feel this will be the next big movement in a gamers user experience to connect with their faction and all the factions. This is where gamers can share their experiences and have ownership of in game assets, we want to re-imagine what a social media platform could possibly be. We want different factions to be able to have an exclusive place but we also want the whole community to be able to meet up as well in the many different ways we can in our normal life. We also want to bring in a new era of land packages to the Faction Social Lounge where you have an opportunity to own limited addition lounge rooms within the community faction lounge setting. These limited addition lounge rooms could host a faction team with limited addition entry passes, a games room where you can chill with other players, conference room for promoting your ideas, a virtual restaurant, movies room, party room, shop, etc. These rooms will be able to be decked out with special in game nft's and also with our <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-NFT-Creative-Art-Community">creative art community</a> special design ntf's for these limited addition rooms. We also want to partnership Lounge rooms to connected with other platforms to grow our game.
  
We understand that not all players are good at battling with in the game so we want social players to earn while participating in our Quests to help maintain and grow our game. Social players will be rewarded by completing Daily Quest and Social Quest where players can earn in game currency and special nft's for completing these tasks especially inviting players to our game. Social players will more than likely own a limited addition lounge room so they can attract and converse with players by offering a gaming experience. Limited addition lounges room will have special in game nft's you can place in our room. You can earn by placing these special nft's in your lounge room but the main earning method is the amount of people in your limited addition room. We want owners to really think about creating an experience for gamers to be entertained in their rooms. We want to significantly reward the owners with large community's within their limited additiion lounge room for their effort in helping to create an atmosphere for players to communicate and enjoy.
  
We also understand investors want to earn not necessarily battle or be social but just want to invest so we are offering a sponsorship program with partnering with a Faction. They will pay a yearly deal which will be very expensive but will earn royalties from all transactions within that faction Lounge. The investor sponsorship will go towards rewards and helping to grow the faction.
  
Again were more than a battling game, were also a social game and we have pathways for investors to earn and their investment goes back to the community to help reward and grow our monoGames communities because we want to provide community experiences and friendships that grow our game, "were building a sustainable gaming ecosystem together with our ever evolving community".
