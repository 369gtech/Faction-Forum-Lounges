<h1>Faction Social Lounges</h1>
<p>
Faction Social Lounges is our second tier social connection which is apart of the heart and soul of monoGames and just like monoGames Social Lounge (monoSol) - we feel this will be the next big movement in a gamers user experience to connect, share and grow with loyal and like minded Faction community members. We want different Factions to be able to have an exclusive place to meet up as well in the many different ways we can in our normal life. We also want to bring in a new era of land packages which gives you the opportunity to own limited addition lounge rooms to create unique gaming experiences which could include hosting a faction team, a games room where you can chill with other players, conference room for promoting your ideas, a virtual restaurant, movies room, party room, shop, etc. These rooms will be able to be decked out with special in game NFT's created by the monoGames NFT Creative Art Community. We also want to create Partnership Lounge Rooms within the Faction which connects with other platforms to grow our game too.
  
We understand that not all players are good at battling within the game so we want social players to earn while participating in our Quests to help maintain and grow our game. Social players will be rewarded by completing Daily Quests, Social Quests, Gaming Quests, Interactive Sustainable Quests, Interactive Social Quests and Referral Quests where players can earn in game currency and special NFT's for completing these tasks. Social players will more than likely own a limited addition lounge room in the monoGames Social Lounge (monoSol) and/or in the Faction Social Lounge so they can attract and converse with players by offering a unique gaming experience. Limited addition lounge rooms will have special in game NFT's created by the monoGames NFT Creative Art Community which you can place in your room. You can earn by placing these special NFT's in your limited addition lounge room but the main earning method is the amount of people in your room. We want owners to really think about creating a unique experience for gamers to be entertained in their limited addition lounge room. We want to significantly reward the owners with large community's within their limited addition lounge room for their effort in helping to create an atmosphere for players to communicate, enjoy and grow our game.
  
We also want to give Silver and Gold Members special privileges where if you're a Silver Member all NFT's in the Faction Social Lounge will automatically be at epic level and if your a Gold Member all NFTâ€™s in the Faction Social Lounge will automatically be at gold level. We want to provide community experiences and friendships in a sustainable gaming ecosystem that is ever evolving and adapting to community needs especially to our Silver and Gold Members.
